To add certificates, the certificates folder must be mounted as a Docker bind volume;
docker run -it --privileged --mount type=bind,source="C:\docker\certificates",target=/opt/gp-flux/certificates


CA Certificates:
All certificates placed in the folder, will be added to the Trusted CA store. This also enables decrypting traffic on firewall.

Machine Certificates:
To use a Machine Certificate for GP authentication, replace the existing docker_machine_cert.crt and docker_machine_cert.key files.
Certificates and Private Key files must be Base64 encoded, and be named docker_machine_cert.crt and docker_machine_cert.key.

User Certificates:
Not yet supported

GP Portal/GW Certificates:
If GP certificate is untrusted for whatever reason, it will try to grab the certificate and add it to the Container's trusted CA store.
This can also manually be enabled, by setting Environmental Variable 'BADCERT' to "true".
